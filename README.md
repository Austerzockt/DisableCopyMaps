# DisableCopyMaps
This is a Plugin requested by u/LegionOfBullets

It only does one simple thing: Disable the Recipe to Copy Maps (in order to protect map art) with the following NBT-Tag: disable_copy set to true
<br>
Every Map you add this tag can't be copied by crafting (other methods of duping should be fixed otherwise)
